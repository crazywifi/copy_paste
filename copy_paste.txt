Observation
During the assessment, it was observed that the server-side SSL/TLS endpoint was configured to allow weak SSL/TLS cipher suites. These cipher suites had known cryptographic flaws, which could have allowed an attacker to decrypt or modify traffic.

Weak cipher suites identified included the following:

SSL/TLS Diffie-Hellman Modulus â‰¤ 1024 Bits (Logjam)
It was observed that the remote server supported DHE cipher suites with keys of 1024 bits or less. The provided evidence confirms this finding. The Logjam attack exploits vulnerabilities in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism when using keys ranging from 512-bit (export-grade) to 1024-bit keys. Through cryptanalysis, an attacker with sufficient resources could have computed the shared secret in a relatively short time, potentially decrypting communications or tampering with encrypted data. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use a minimum key size of 2048 bits for secure Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.

SSL Certificate Signed Using a Weak Hashing Algorithm
It was observed that the SSL certificate was signed using the cryptographically weak SHA-1 algorithm. This hashing algorithm is known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. A determined attacker could have exploited this weakness to generate a fraudulent certificate with the same digital signature, allowing them to impersonate the affected service.

SSL Certificate Expiry
The analysis revealed that the SSL certificates associated with SSL-enabled services on the target had already expired. The expiry of an SSL certificate could have led to a loss of trust, security warnings from browsers, potential data breaches, and an increased susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks. This could have compromised sensitive user information and negatively impacted the organization's reputation.
