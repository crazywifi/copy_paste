Observation: Default Pages Found
Analysis
During the assessment, it was observed that the remote server contained default error pages, index pages, example JSPs, and/or example servlets. These files are typically included in default installations and could have provided insights into the serverâ€™s configuration. The provided evidence confirms this finding.

Impact
The presence of exposed default installation or "Welcome" pages indicated that the server may not have been properly configured or secured. This could have helped attackers identify the underlying technologies, software versions, and server configurations, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Additionally, servers with default pages are often overlooked in patching and monitoring processes, increasing the risk of compromise.

Recommendation
It is recommended to remove all default pages and example files to prevent the disclosure of sensitive server information. Instead, custom error and index pages should be used to enhance security. If the service is not required, it should be disabled. For specific instructions on removing default pages in IIS and Tomcat, refer to the documentation linked in the references.
