Vulnerability Name: Insufficient Anti-Automation Mechanism
Description:
During the assessment, it was observed that the application lacked sufficient anti-automation mechanisms, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This weakness could have allowed attackers to automate login attempts using large credential lists, potentially leading to unauthorized account access. Without proper rate limiting or CAPTCHA protection, the application was susceptible to credential stuffing and password-guessing attacks.

Impact:
Unauthorized Access: Attackers could have used automated tools to repeatedly attempt logins, potentially gaining access to user accounts.
Account Compromise: Users with weak or reused passwords could have been particularly vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks.
Increased Load on the Server: A large number of automated login attempts could have led to performance issues or a denial-of-service condition.
Regulatory Compliance Risks: Lack of anti-automation mechanisms may have resulted in non-compliance with security standards such as OWASP ASVS, NIST, or PCI-DSS.
Recommendation:
It is recommended to implement rate limiting on login endpoints to restrict the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
It is recommended to enforce CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to differentiate between human users and automated bots.
It is recommended to use account lockout mechanisms, such as temporarily disabling login attempts after multiple failed attempts.
It is recommended to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
It is recommended to monitor and log authentication attempts to detect and respond to abnormal login behavior.
It is recommended to encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and enforce password policies to reduce the risk of credential stuffing attacks.
