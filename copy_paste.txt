During the assessment, it was observed that the application was using an outdated version of the jQuery library (3.2.1), which contained known security vulnerabilities. JavaScript libraries are frequently updated with security patches, and using outdated versions can introduce risks to the application. The identified version of jQuery was vulnerable to the following security issues:

CVE-2019-11358 – A prototype pollution vulnerability in jQuery, which could have allowed attackers to manipulate JavaScript objects and execute unintended actions.
CVE-2020-11002 – Security flaws that could have been exploited to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Impact:
The presence of outdated JavaScript libraries could have exposed the application to multiple security risks, including:

Account hijacking through exploitation of JavaScript vulnerabilities.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
Data manipulation and leakage, compromising sensitive user information.
Increased attack surface, making the application more vulnerable to known exploits.
Recommendation:

It is recommended to update jQuery to the latest stable and secure version to patch known vulnerabilities.
It is recommended to review application dependencies and ensure all third-party JavaScript libraries are regularly updated.
It is recommended to perform security testing after updating libraries to verify compatibility and functionality.
It is recommended to implement a software update policy to regularly check for security patches and apply them promptly.
