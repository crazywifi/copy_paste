Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that Adobe ColdFusion 2021 was in use. However, due to black-box testing limitations, it was not possible to verify if the latest security updates had been applied. ColdFusion 2021 had multiple known vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21087, CVE-2021-40698, CVE-2024-53961), and an outdated version could have exposed the system to security risks.

Impact:
If the ColdFusion instance was not updated, attackers could have exploited known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or perform remote attacks. This could have led to data breaches, service disruptions, and potential system compromise.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to verify the ColdFusion version and apply the latest security patches provided by Adobe. Additionally, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure that the system remains protected against emerging threats.
