Unauthenticated Redis Instance Exposed
Description:
During the assessment, it was observed that the Redis server was configured without password authentication, making it susceptible to unauthorized access. Redis, a widely used in-memory database, cache, and message broker, allows clients to connect and execute commands without requiring authentication when no password is set. This misconfiguration could have allowed attackers to remotely access and manipulate the Redis database without any restrictions, posing a significant security risk.


Impact:
The absence of password authentication on the Redis server could have allowed attackers to:

Gain unauthorized access to the Redis database.
View, modify, or delete stored data.
Execute malicious commands, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
Use the Redis instance for malware distribution, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the network.
Completely compromise the server, affecting application availability and security.
Recommendation:

It is recommended to enable authentication in the Redis configuration file (redis.conf) by setting a strong password using the requirepass directive.
It is recommended to restrict remote access to the Redis server by binding it to localhost (bind 127.0.0.1) or using a firewall to allow access only from trusted IP addresses.
It is recommended to enable TLS encryption for Redis to protect data in transit.
It is recommended to apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring Redis runs with minimal system permissions.
It is recommended to regularly audit the Redis configuration and apply security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
