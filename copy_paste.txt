Vulnerability Name: SSH Terrapin Prefix Truncation Weakness (CVE-2023-48795)
Description:
During the assessment, it was identified that the SSH service was vulnerable to Terrapin Prefix Truncation Weakness (CVE-2023-48795). This vulnerability exploits weaknesses in SSHâ€™s prefix truncation handling during the key exchange process, allowing an attacker to manipulate the encryption negotiation and downgrade security settings. As a result, the attacker could potentially weaken the SSH encryption, leading to session hijacking or unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over SSH.

Impact:
Attackers could downgrade the encryption algorithms, making SSH communications more susceptible to interception or manipulation.
This could allow for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could eavesdrop or alter SSH sessions.
Compromised SSH sessions could lead to credential theft, command injection, or further exploitation of the target system.
Recommendation:
Upgrade SSH server and client software to the latest patched version that mitigates CVE-2023-48795.
Disable weak and vulnerable key exchange methods in SSH configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config).
Enforce strong cryptographic algorithms, such as AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and avoid deprecated ciphers.
Monitor SSH logs for unusual authentication patterns or connection downgrades that may indicate an attack attempt.
If possible, implement network-level mitigations, such as restricting SSH access to trusted IP addresses and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH logins.
