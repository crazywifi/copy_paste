Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that the application did not include the X-Content-Type-Options HTTP response header. This header is a security feature designed to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared Content-Type, reducing the risk of certain types of attacks such as content-type spoofing. The absence of this header could have allowed browsers to interpret files in unintended ways, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

Impact:
Without the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header, browsers might attempt to determine the content type of a resource dynamically, which could result in the execution of malicious scripts or unauthorized content rendering. This could increase the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, content injection, or other security issues, potentially compromising user data and application integrity.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to configure the web server or application to include the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header in all HTTP responses. This ensures that browsers strictly adhere to the declared Content-Type and do not attempt MIME-sniffing. Implementing this header as part of a broader security strategy can help mitigate content-type-based attacks and enhance overall web application security.


Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that the application did not include the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header. This header is a security measure designed to prevent clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a webpage can be embedded within an <iframe>. The absence of this header could have allowed an attacker to load the application within a malicious site, tricking users into interacting with hidden elements.

Impact:
Without the X-Frame-Options header, the application could have been vulnerable to clickjacking attacks, where an attacker overlays invisible elements on a trusted page to steal user input, such as login credentials or sensitive actions. This could have led to account compromise, unauthorized transactions, or other malicious activities.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to configure the web server or application to include the X-Frame-Options header in HTTP responses. The recommended values are:

X-Frame-Options: DENY → Completely prevents the page from being embedded in an <iframe>.
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN → Allows embedding only within the same origin.
Additionally, modern applications should consider using the Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive for more flexible and secure frame control.
