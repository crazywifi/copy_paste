Description:
During the analysis, it was observed that the server was vulnerable to the SWEET32 attack due to the use of weak 64-bit ciphers. These ciphers, such as 3DES (Triple DES), were enabled on the server and could have been exploited by attackers to perform collision attacks and decrypt encrypted traffic.

Impact:
The presence of medium-strength 64-bit ciphers could have allowed attackers to exploit the SWEET32 vulnerability, potentially decrypting SSL/TLS communication and exposing sensitive information. This could have led to data breaches, unauthorized access, or compromise of encrypted sessions, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to disable weak 64-bit ciphers, such as 3DES, and configure the server to use stronger encryption algorithms like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. The SSL/TLS configuration should be updated to restrict medium-strength ciphers and enforce the use of modern, secure protocols such as TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3. Additionally, a security review should be conducted to ensure compliance with industry best practices and regulatory standards.
