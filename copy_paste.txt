This issue was reported as **Low severity** rather than **Medium** because there were no publicly available exploits to take advantage of the deprecated **TLS 1.0** protocol. Additionally, the assessment was conducted on a **black-box, unauthenticated application**, which limited the ability to fully evaluate potential exploitability.
