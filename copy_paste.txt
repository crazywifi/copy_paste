Vulnerability: Use of Basic Authentication
Description:
During the assessment, it was observed that the application or server was using Basic Authentication for user authentication. Basic Authentication transmits credentials (username and password) in plaintext (Base64-encoded) without encryption, making it susceptible to interception, especially over unencrypted HTTP connections.

Impact:
Credentials can be easily captured through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if transmitted over an unprotected channel.
Attackers can decode Base64-encoded credentials and gain unauthorized access.
Increases the risk of credential theft, account compromise, and privilege escalation if credentials are reused across multiple systems.
Lack of session management, as Basic Authentication requires credentials to be sent with each request, increasing exposure.
Recommendation:
Disable Basic Authentication and use modern, secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML.
If password-based authentication is required, implement Digest Authentication or mutual TLS authentication instead.
Ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced to strengthen security.
Always use TLS (HTTPS) to encrypt authentication traffic, preventing credential exposure.
Consider using token-based authentication such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication for better security and session management.
Implementing these measures will enhance security and protect user credentials from interception and misuse.




Description:
During the assessment, it was observed that the web application was not properly configured to handle errors, resulting in the disclosure of detailed stack traces and error exceptions to end users. These error messages contained information that could have helped an attacker understand the backend technologies and frameworks used by the application.

Impact:
Exposing detailed error messages could have allowed an attacker to gather specific information about the applicationâ€™s components, including software versions, database configurations, and framework details. This information could have helped an attacker focus on exploiting known vulnerabilities within the disclosed technologies, increasing the risk of targeted attacks.

Analysis:
During testing, it was found that when a user inserted special characters into certain URLs, the application returned an error page containing backend configuration details. This improper handling of errors could have provided attackers with insights into the application's internal structure. The provided evidence confirms this behavior.

Remediation:
Implement custom error pages to display generic messages to end users while logging detailed errors on the server.
Configure the application to handle all types of exceptions securely, ensuring that sensitive details are not exposed.
Ensure error messages provide only necessary diagnostic information, such as validation errors, without revealing stack traces or developer-level debugging details.
Regularly review logs for errors and potential security risks while ensuring logs do not expose sensitive information.
Applying these measures will help prevent information disclosure and reduce the risk of targeted attacks.
