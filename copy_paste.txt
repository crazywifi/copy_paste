Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that the remote NTP server responds to Mode 6 queries. Devices that allow such queries can be exploited for NTP amplification attacks. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could use specially crafted Mode 6 queries to trigger a reflected denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

Impact:
Attackers can leverage Mode 6 responses to amplify traffic, leading to large-scale DoS attacks against targeted systems. This can degrade network performance, disrupt services, and potentially impact other critical infrastructure relying on NTP synchronization.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to restrict NTP Mode 6 queries to trusted sources by applying appropriate access control lists (ACLs). Additionally, unnecessary NTP query functionalities should be disabled, and the NTP service should be updated to the latest secure version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
