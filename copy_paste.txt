Vulnerability Name: Improper Validation of Redirect URI in OAuth Request
Description:
During the assessment of the web application, it was identified that the redirect URI in the OAuth request was not properly validated. Due to the limitations of black-box testing, no explicit error related to redirect URI validation was observed. However, the application returned general errors unrelated to redirection, preventing further testing. This behavior suggests that the validation mechanism for redirect URIs could not be fully verified, and its security posture remains uncertain.

Impact (Informational):
If the redirect URI is not properly validated, it could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing attacks or OAuth token leakage.
An improperly validated redirect URI could be exploited in OAuth token hijacking scenarios, potentially compromising user sessions.
However, since the application was not functioning properly and full validation could not be confirmed, this issue is reported as informational for further review.
Recommendation:
Ensure strict validation of redirect URIs by only allowing predefined and trusted domains in OAuth requests.
Use exact URI matching instead of wildcard or partial matching to prevent unauthorized redirections.
Implement security headers such as X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy to prevent clickjacking attacks related to OAuth flows.
Conduct further testing once the application is functional to confirm whether the redirect URI validation is properly enforced.
Would you like me to adjust the wording based on any specific reporting format you follow?
