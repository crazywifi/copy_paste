It is recommended to disable the use of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode ciphers in SSH as they are considered vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. CBC mode ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks, making them susceptible to attacks such as plaintext recovery and padding oracle attacks.

It is recommended to replace CBC ciphers with stronger alternatives, such as ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-GCM, which offer authenticated encryption and better security.
