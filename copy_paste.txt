Observation: Deprecated IIS Version in Use
Description:
During the analysis, it was observed that the server was running a deprecated version of IIS (IIS 8.5). This version is no longer actively supported with security updates, leaving it vulnerable to potential exploits.

Impact:
Using an outdated IIS version increases the risk of security vulnerabilities, including unpatched exploits, privilege escalation, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Attackers may take advantage of known weaknesses in the deprecated version to compromise the server, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to upgrade to a supported version of IIS, such as IIS 10 or the latest stable release, to ensure continued security updates and improved functionality. Additionally, all security patches and updates should be applied regularly to mitigate potential threats.
