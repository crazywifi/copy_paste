Issue Summary:
During the assessment, it was observed that the application did not properly implement essential security headers, including:

X-Content-Type-Options
X-Frame-Options
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
Cache-Control and Pragma
Content-Security-Policy
Security headers provide an additional layer of protection against various web-based attacks, including MIME-type sniffing, clickjacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data caching vulnerabilities.

Recommendations:
X-Content-Type-Options:

Set the header to: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
This prevents MIME type sniffing, ensuring browsers strictly honor the declared content type.
X-Frame-Options:

Set the header to: X-Frame-Options: DENY
This prevents the application from being embedded in iframes, mitigating clickjacking attacks.
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):

Set the header to: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
This forces all future connections to use HTTPS, improving transport security.
Cache-Control and Pragma:

Set the headers as follows:
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
These prevent the caching of sensitive data, reducing the risk of exposure.
Content-Security-Policy (CSP):

Define a strict CSP policy to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
Example:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com; object-src 'none'  
Implementing these headers will enhance the application's security posture and mitigate potential risks.
