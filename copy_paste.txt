Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that the SMTP server was configured as an open relay, allowing email transmission without proper authentication. Testing confirmed that it was possible to send emails from the internal domain to external recipients, from the internal domain to internal addresses, and from external domains to internal addresses. This misconfiguration could have allowed unauthorized entities to misuse the server for sending unsolicited emails.

Impact:
An open SMTP relay could have been exploited by attackers to send spam, phishing emails, or conduct email spoofing. This could have led to the SMTP server being blacklisted by email providers, disrupted email communications, and potentially facilitated social engineering attacks against users.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to configure the SMTP server to restrict email relaying by implementing authentication and access control policies. The server should be set to allow email relay only for trusted sources, and logging should be enabled to monitor for any unauthorized email activity.
