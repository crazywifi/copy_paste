During the assessment, it was observed that the application was using an outdated and vulnerable version of ASP.NET (4.0.30319). This version had known security vulnerabilities that could have been exploited by attackers to compromise the application or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Outdated components, both client-side and server-side, often lack security patches, making them a target for exploitation.

The Penetration Testing Team identified that the outdated ASP.NET version was vulnerable to the following CVE-listed vulnerabilities:

CVE-2015-2455 – Security flaw that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2019-19731 – Vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure and compromise application security.
Impact:
The use of a vulnerable and outdated ASP.NET version could have exposed the application to multiple security risks, including:

Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server.
Information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users.
Increased attack surface, as known vulnerabilities could have been exploited by attackers to compromise the application's integrity and availability.
Regulatory non-compliance, as using outdated software may violate security policies and industry standards.
Recommendation:

It is recommended to upgrade ASP.NET to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
It is recommended to regularly update all third-party components to ensure security patches are applied.
It is recommended to perform regular vulnerability scans to identify and address outdated or unsupported software.
It is recommended to apply security hardening measures to minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
It is recommended to monitor security advisories for updates related to ASP.NET and other dependencies.
