Description:
During the analysis, it was identified that the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) service allowed authentication over an unencrypted connection. AMQP is a widely used messaging protocol that enables communication between distributed systems, facilitating reliable message queuing, routing, and transactions. It is commonly used in microservices architectures, cloud environments, and enterprise messaging systems. However, we detected that AMQP was running on port 5672 (default, unencrypted) instead of the secure TLS-encrypted port 5671, which could have exposed authentication credentials.

Impact:
Allowing authentication over an unencrypted AMQP connection could have led to the interception of credentials by attackers through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This could have resulted in unauthorized access to the message queue, leading to data leakage, message manipulation, or disruption of message-based communications within the system. If exploited, this could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of inter-service communications, affecting application functionality and security.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to configure the AMQP service to use TLS encryption (port 5671) to protect authentication credentials and message integrity. Additionally, strict access controls should be enforced, and unnecessary plaintext authentication should be disabled to mitigate security risks. Regular security assessments should be conducted to ensure compliance with best practices and to verify that all AMQP communications are securely encrypted.
