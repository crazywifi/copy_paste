Description:
During the analysis, it was observed that the application transmitted sensitive information over unencrypted channels, such as HTTP, making it vulnerable to interception. This insecure transmission method exposed authentication credentials, personal data, or other sensitive information, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Examples included Basic authentication credentials being sent in plaintext, form-based authentication transmitted via HTTP, and unencrypted transmission of regulated or sensitive data.

Impact:
The transmission of sensitive data over unencrypted channels could have allowed attackers to intercept and capture confidential information through network sniffing. This could have resulted in account takeovers, identity theft, data breaches, and regulatory non-compliance. Additionally, attackers could have exploited the intercepted data to gain unauthorized access to the application, leading to further security compromises.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to enforce encryption by using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher) to protect data in transit.
It is recommended to disable HTTP and configure automatic redirection to HTTPS to prevent unencrypted connections.
It is recommended to use strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or multi-factor authentication (MFA), to enhance security.
It is recommended to conduct regular security assessments to identify and mitigate any instances of plaintext data transmission.
It is recommended to comply with security regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) by ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.
By implementing these measures, the risk of data interception and unauthorized access can be significantly reduced.
