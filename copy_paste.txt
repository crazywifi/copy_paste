The penetration testing team conducted a security assessment of the aaa application. The assessment was performed using a black-box, unauthenticated approach on the designated applications and IP addresses.

During the assessment, one high-risk, one medium-risk, four low-risk, and three informational findings were identified. An Nmap scan was performed on the IP addresses. Many reachable IP addresses had multiple open ports, and the team enumerated the associated services. The team also attempted to identify misconfigurations and weak authentication across various services through brute-force attacks and other relevant security evaluations.

The assessment revealed that the Redis server was not protected by authentication, allowing unauthorized enumeration. Additionally, directory enumeration was performed to locate web applications on web services, but no results were found. The team also identified the use of Basic Authentication, which is not a secure approach for login. Furthermore, an obsolete version of IIS was observed in use.
